  ### **Introduction**

Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the most common type of thyroid cancer, accounting for over 90% of cases. It encompasses two main histological subtypes: papillary and follicular thyroid cancer. While the prognosis for DTC is generally favorable, with high survival rates, recurrence remains a significant concern. Predicting recurrence is crucial for patient management and treatment planning.

This project aims to develop a classification model to predict the recurrence of well-differentiated thyroid cancer using a dataset containing 13 clinicopathologic features. The dataset includes information collected over 15 years, with each patient being followed for at least 10 years. The primary objective is to evaluate different machine learning models and determine which model best predicts recurrence, thereby aiding in more effective patient management.
